The package in 'svn/trunk/types' shares common code with
'svn/trunk/odlc' and 'svn/trunk/gae'.

    The 'odlc' package is a command line / ant tool for generating JPL
    source code from the templates defined in 'odlc/xtm'.  This tool
    is copied (as a jar file containing xtm) to applications' 'ant'
    directory for generating code from ODL schemae.

    The 'gae' package implements the Gap Data runtime.

The 'svn/yastwsstream' package is an example application.  May be
rusty (out of sync) at times.

The 'svn/yusu' package is used by 'yastwsstream' for the twitter api.
