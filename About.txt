The package in 'types' shares common code with 'odlc' and 'trunk'.

The 'odlc' package is a command line / ant tool for generating JPL
source code from the templates defined in 'odlc/xtm'.  This tool is
copied (as a jar file containing xtm) to applications' 'ant' directory
for generating code from ODL schemae.

The 'trunk' package implements the Gap Data runtime.

The 'yastwsstream' package is an example application.  May be rusty
(out of sync) at times.

The 'yusu' package is used by 'yastwsstream' for the twitter api.
