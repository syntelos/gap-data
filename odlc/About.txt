Lots of code to delete, this package is essentially "gap.odl.Main" without any appengine dependencies aside from data types.

From 1.3.0 to 1.3.1 appengine changed the command line environment to push away from appengine runtime environment.

For the moment this change can be seen in gap/util/Main.jav

All of this makes sense, as appengine is for smaller things not larger things according to its economic scalability.  

The server side drops all design time ideas, pushed out to the desktop.
