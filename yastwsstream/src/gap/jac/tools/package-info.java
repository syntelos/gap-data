/**
 * Provides interfaces for tools which can be invoked from a program,
 * for example, compilers.
 *
 * <p>These interfaces and classes are required as part of the
 * Java&trade; Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE),
 * but there is no requirement to provide any tools implementing them.
 *
 * <p>Unless explicitly allowed, all methods in this package might
 * throw a {@linkplain java.lang.NullPointerException} if given a
 * {@code null} argument or if given a
 * {@linkplain java.lang.Iterable list or collection} containing
 * {@code null} elements.  Similarly, no method may return
 * {@code null} unless explicitly allowed.
 *
 * <p>This package is the home of the Java programming language compiler framework.  This
 * framework allows clients of the framework to locate and run
 * compilers from programs.  The framework also provides Service
 * Provider Interfaces (SPI) for structured access to diagnostics
 * ({@linkplain gap.jac.tools.DiagnosticListener}) as well as a file
 * abstraction for overriding file access ({@linkplain
 * gap.jac.tools.JavaFileManager} and {@linkplain
 * gap.jac.tools.JavaFileObject}).  See {@linkplain
 * gap.jac.tools.JavaCompiler} for more details on using the SPI.
 *
 * <p>There is no requirement for a compiler at runtime.  However, if
 * a default compiler is provided, it can be located using the
 * {@linkplain gap.jac.tools.ToolProvider}, for example:
 *
 * <p>{@code JavaCompiler compiler = ToolProvider.getSystemJavaCompiler();}
 *
 * <p>It is possible to provide alternative compilers or tools
 * through the {@linkplain java.util.ServiceLoader service provider
 * mechanism}.
 *
 * <p>For example, if {@code com.vendor.VendorJavaCompiler} is a
 * provider of the {@code JavaCompiler} tool then its jar file
 * would contain the file {@code
 * META-INF/services/gap.jac.tools.JavaCompiler}.  This file would
 * contain the single line:
 *
 * <p>{@code com.vendor.VendorJavaCompiler}
 *
 * <p>If the jar file is on the class path, VendorJavaCompiler can be
 * located using code like this:
 *
 * <p>{@code JavaCompiler compiler = ServiceLoader.load(JavaCompiler.class).iterator().next();}
