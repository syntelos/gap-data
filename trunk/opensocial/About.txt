 The class "oso.data.Person" is used by the Gap Data runtime
 (subpackage "gae") for all logins.  This "oso" (opensocial)
 subpackage separates this class from the "gae" subpackage for the
 benefit of applications that modify this class.

 To use this implementation, copy the product JAR file into
 application "lib" directory, contents of directory "odl" into the
 application "lib/odl" directory, and merge the contents of
 "src/META-INF/services" files with the application services files.

 To replicate this implementation, copy the odl files into the
 application odl tree and compile -- run "ant odl" in the application
 directory.
