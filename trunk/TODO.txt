** Make 'unique id' a default in BigTable
*** ID from key

* Review primitive types handling in data template
** Field type 'int' bug!
*** The template generated list code 
*** Type spec could have been converted to 'Integer' or an exception should have been thrown

** Staticize gap-data 
*** Jar classes into lib
