   Some notes to be expanded


Servlet 

   The centerpiece is gap/service/Servlet which is called on each HTTP
   request through a subclass.

   
Data

   The gap/data package includes the BigTable class which is inherited
   by data beans generated from the gap/odl package.


Templates

   The gap/hapax package integrates a fast template processor.
   Template sources found in web/WEB-INF/templates include HTML and
   JAVA generators.  These are copied into the respective product
   target directory from where they are used at build (design) time
   and run time.


System

   The term "system" is employed relative to memcache.  It applies to
   the instances of an application sharing a single memcache space.
