   Some notes to be expanded


Servlet 

   The centerpiece is gap/service/Servlet which is called on each HTTP
   request through a subclass.

   
Data

   The gap/data package includes the BigTable class which is inherited
   by data beans generated from the gap/odl package.


Templates

   The gap/hapax package integrates a fast template processor.
   Template sources found in web/WEB-INF/templates include HTML and
   JAVA generators.


System

   The term "system" is employed relative to memcache.  It applies to
   the instances of an application sharing a single memcache space.
