#summary svn versioning

 When the svn java sources are modified, a conflict is created within the subversion package maintenance downlink.

 To manage these few conflicts, it would be best to perform a backup, revert, update, and restore procedure.

 copy the current conflict modified files out of their locations to short term storage, e.g.

{{{
  tar cvf /tmp gap-data/trunk $(cat mods.flist)
}}}

 *revert* the files using 
{{{
  svn revert
}}}

 *update* the package at maintenance points, major or minor number changes, using
{{{
  svn update
}}}
 *restore* by writing the modified files from the short store over the package repository.
{{{
  tar xfp /tmp/tmp
}}}


 = Conflicting files =

 The only conflicting files should be [Application] and

{{{
 gap-data/trunk/web/WEB-INF/templates
}}}
