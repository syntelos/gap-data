 Gap Data is always running at http://gap-data.appspot.com/

 = Installation =

 == Prerequisites ==
 * Java JDK 1.6 or later
 * Apache Ant 1.6.5 or later

 == Procedure ==

 The source repo checks- out into the gap-data appengine application.

 Edit "project.application" to point it to your own appengine name.

 Run "ant" to build, and then 
{{{
 ./appengine-java-sdk/1.2.5/bin/appcfg -e email@dom update war
}}}
 to install.

 After appcfg has been successfully employed once, then "ant update" can repeat that process if necessary.

 See [Application], [AntBuild], and [AppCfg].
