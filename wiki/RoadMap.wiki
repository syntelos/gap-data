#summary Principal elements of the future course of development

= Configuration =

The checkout, configure, build, and update usage needs to be developed.  At the moment it's not truly designed for this, but for manual editing and maintenance.

= Automation =

The plan, visible in the codebase, is for the ODL description to be augmented in future by a usage starting from a plain old java bean marked up with "gap.data" annotations.  The same model expressed in ODL will be able to be expressed in JPL in the bean.

In this case, the bean will be rewritten in the compilation phase to extend a superclass that is the current generated code.  

Programming from the user bean will access all of the functions and methods currently available, and to be developed.

= Persistent Bean Features =

Currently dysfunctional but to be corrected in the codebase is support for collections methods for bean fields.

To be developed are list/set and map by reference collection classes.  This effort will solve the tag problem for a list of tags on a bean.
