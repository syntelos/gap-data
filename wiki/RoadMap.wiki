#summary Principal elements of the future course of development

= Configuration =

The checkout, configure, build, and update usage needs to be developed.  At the moment it's not truly designed for this, but for manual editing and maintenance.

= Automation =

The plan, visible in the codebase, is for the ODL description to be augmented in future by a usage starting from a plain old java bean marked up with "gap.data" annotations.  The same model expressed in ODL will be able to be expressed in JPL in the bean.

In this case, the bean will be rewritten to extend a superclass that is the current generated code.
